# Clover Node.js Library

The Clover Node library provides convenient access to the Clover API from
applications written in server-side JavaScript.

Please keep in mind that this package is for use with server-side Node that
uses Clover secret keys. To maintain PCI compliance, tokenization of credit
card information should always be done with [Clover.js][clover-js] on the
client side. This package should not be used for that purpose.

## Documentation

See the [Node API docs](https://clover.com/docs/api/node#intro).

## Installation

Install the package with:

```sh
npm install clover-ecomm-sdk --save
```
or

```sh
$ yarn install
```

## Usage

The package needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is
available in your [Clover Dashboard][api-keys]. Require it with the key's
value:

```js
const clover = require('clover')('ck_test_...');

const customer = await clover.customers.create({
  email: 'customer@example.com',
});
```

On older versions of Node, you can use [promises](#using-promises)
or [callbacks](#using-callbacks) instead of `async`/`await`.
